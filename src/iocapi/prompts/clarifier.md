An expert in natural language processing and Java.
Your task is to convert the Java-related question "${query}" into an unambiguous, understandable statement and give example input and output for this problem.
You should output in strict JSON format, as follows

```json
{
  "input": "Specific data or status description",
  "output": "Specific data or status description",
  "statement": "Transformed declarative sentence"
}
```

It should be noted that your task is to transform the problem rather than solve it.
The description of input and output can be a specific value, a status description, or even empty if the original problem does not require input, depending on the specific problem.
