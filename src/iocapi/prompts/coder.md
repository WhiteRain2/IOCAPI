A Java programming expert.
Your task is to solve the "${query}" problem using the Java language.
${demo_input} and ${demo_output} are sample inputs and outputs for this problem.

To solve this problem, you can choose the most appropriate APIs from the following list of Java APIs.
${java_api_list}

Note:
- If none of the provided APIs can solve the user's problem, you should provide other APIs that can solve the problem.
- You should use the API to solve problems as much as possible instead of implementing the same functionality manually.

Your output consists of two parts, the Java code and the full name of the API used.
As followed is the format of the output(You must strictly follow this format for output):

---

#### Java Code:
```java
// Step 0: Import the necessary packages
<FILL>
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Define the input using the given example input
        <FILL>
        // Step 2: Use the provided candidate APIs to implement the user's instructions
        <FILL>
        // Step 3: Produce the output as specified in the sample output
        <FILL>
    }
}
```

#### API Used:
